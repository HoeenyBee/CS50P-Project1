## Description
This is my first Python project from the CS50P course. The program prompts the user for input and outputs the same text in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace remain unchanged. The project helped me practice string methods and user input handling in Python.

## Learning Outcomes
- Using Python string methods 
- Using "input()"
- Reading and understanding Python documentation

## Usage 
1. Clone or download the repository to your computer
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing "indoor.py". For example, if you cloned the repo:
```bash
cd name-of-repo-folder
python indoor.py

Type your input and press Enter. The program prints the text in lowercase.
